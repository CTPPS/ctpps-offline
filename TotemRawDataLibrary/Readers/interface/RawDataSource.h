/**
 * \ingroup TotemRawData
 * \brief Reads in TOTEM raw data file(s) and puts Totem::RawEvent into the Event structure.
 *
 * Each input file is treated as one run. If setRunNumberFromFileName is set to false, the runs
 * are enumerated consecutively: 1, 2, 3... If setRunNumberFromFileName is true, run numbers are
 * extracted from file names. The following file name format is expected:
 * \verbatim path/some text<run>some text<file>some text \endverbatim
 * The "/" denotes the last slash in the path. <run> and <file> contain digits only, <run> must
 * be greater than 1, <file> can have 4 digits only (i.e. it must smaller than 10000). <file> is
 * optional, if missing, 0 will be used instead. The (CMSSW) run number is then composed as
 * \verbatim run number = <run> * 1E4 + <file> \endverbatim
 *
 * The module starts a new luminosity block whenever the UNIX timestamp of raw event changes.
 * In CMSSW 7.x it is essential for synchronisation with EventSetup: it can only be updated at
 * luminosity-block boundaries.
